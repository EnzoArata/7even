# 7even

<p>I developed 7even when I was working for myself and making a living by buying in demand products and up selling them. After losing my job due to covid layoffs I had to figure out a way to make money and support myself</p>



## Concept

<p>High demand value products sell out in seconds because they are easy to flip for high profit margins. If you can get information fast when products drop to a website then your chance of acquiring the item sky rockets<p>

<p>Windows application designed to help aquire in demand products.Is able to monitor different websites and inform you of when products have come in to stock</p>

## Features

-Supports multiple websites (Asus, Target, Walmart, BH Photo, Gamenerdz)
-Can monitor specific items when they become available
-Integrates into discord, sends user a message when an item is available for purchase



## Experimental/In Development features

-Ability to buy items automatically, tested and worked on site Gamenerdz
-Ability to pop out browser window so user can solve captchas
